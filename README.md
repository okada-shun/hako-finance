# Hako System Project / 匣制計劃

"Hako System Project" is a project to make an innovative system for creating token.   
In this system, makes "Hako Token" and uses it.

## Hako Token is like what token?

Before describing Hako Token, I have to tell you about "What is token?".   
Token is a substitute for money.  
Then, what is money?  
Money was born from what?  
There are two theories about this question.  
The first one, that is mainstream, is "Born from barter". In ancient times, people traded goods for other goods. This was inconvenient. So, as the medium of barter, people came to use money. This theory is called "commodity money theory". Many cryptocurrencies and tokens including bitcoin are based on this theory.  
The second one, that is non-mainstream, is "Born from I OWE YOU". When someone borrows someting from someone else, IOU(I owe you) comes out. This IOU circulates, reaches at many people's hand, so comes to money. This theory is called "credit theory of money", "debt theory of money" or "modern monetary theory (MMT)".

Hako Token is based on the latter theory unlike the other tokens. In docs, I tell you about the exact theory of this token system.
