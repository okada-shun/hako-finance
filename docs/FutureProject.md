# About the future project

I have some points to think and improve in the future project. Listed below.

1. Incentives to member's credit lending  
For now, hako member can lend credit to other member. However he can't get any incentives from doing that. So, it's necessary to think about incentives to member's credit lending. For example, whether or not to set something like interest? But, this system is made with the intention that "Lending Without Interest" and it is possible!

2. Preventing account overfishing  
As I described in "Hako owner" document, it is possible that a single man uses multiple accounts. If so, this man will probably make the best use of those accounts to the debt limit and get maximum benefit. Also this man will probably throw away the account that has much debt to hako. If so, the demand for generated token disappears and the price of token crashes! This is a trouble named "Hyper Inflation".  
To avoid this, I set the upper limit of credit creation and credit lending. However, if the man uses many, many, many accounts, it will be inevitable that some inflation happens. So, it is necessary to think about the way to prevent users from using so many accounts.
